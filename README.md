## **PROJECT TITLE: ROMCOM**

*People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well … maybe that’s true.* This app creates randomized combinations of cheap romance novel covers, titles and taglines. Taglines are constructed by inserting two random descriptor words into the pre-formatted phrase: 'A tale of x and x'. Users can also create their own romance novel covers and save any created covers to a library that can be accessed at any point.
